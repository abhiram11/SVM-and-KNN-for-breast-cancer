S = supports vectors
V = vector space se deal krega
M = relation with a system

better than neural network for handwritten recognition etc..
one of the most complex algo


- euclidean distance from the separating hyperplane
- is a binary classifier(2 groups + and -)
- find out best separating hyperplane, and classify data points as + or - according to it

separates into two groups, for more than 2, eg 3.. divides into 2==> 1 alag baaki 2 ek group me

- represented in 2D space, atmost 3D space
